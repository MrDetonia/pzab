This directory contains several example programs to run in the PZAB interpreter.

hello.pzab
----------
Outputs "Hello, world!".

memtest.pzab
------------
This fills all 256 memory cells with 1s, and then with 0s.

adder.pzab
----------
Takes 2 integers from the user and outputs their sum.
This uses a standard ripple carry adder algorithm.

twos.pzab
---------
Takes an integer from the user and performs a two's complement on the number.
Note: The output is unsigned.

subber.pzab
-----------
Takes 2 integers from the user and outputs the first minus the second.
This combines two's complement with the adder.
